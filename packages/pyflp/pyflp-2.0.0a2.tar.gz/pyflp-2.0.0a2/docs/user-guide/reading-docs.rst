|rtd-icon| Reading the docs
===========================

Most libraries have pages full of information on how to use them. But PyFLP is
a parser. It has less "functions" and more "properties" and collections. It's
entire end-user documentation lies in its :doc:`reference <../reference>`.

PyFLP's modules are arranged such that they follow FL Studio's GUI hierarchy
as much as possible. In addition to that I have complemented the docstrings
with tables and images whenever required, so the reference looks far more human
readable.

The docstrings are :doc:`good enough <./features>` to give a feel of what you
are doing, so you won't need to visit the documentation a lot, once you know
how the API layout is.

Here's a brief summary of PyFLP's modules:
