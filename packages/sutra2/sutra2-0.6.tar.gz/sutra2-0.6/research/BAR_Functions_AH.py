    The travel time in the upper aquifer is based on design
    characteristics of the BAR system, which is rigorously
    schematized as indicated in Fig.A3.1. The schematisation
    and analytical solutions are based on Huisman & Olsthoorn
    (1983) and Stuyfzand & van der Schans (2018), with a
    MAR system composed of parallel spreading basins and
    drainage galleries in between, with phreatic aquifer
    characteristics and typical recharge system requirements.

    The design follows from the equations given below, assuming that:
    (i) flow is predominantly horizontal (Dupuit assumption;
    also excluding unsaturated zone beneath basin), requiring
    that both the spreading basin and drainage gallery fully
    penetrates the saturated thickness of the aquifer;
    (ii) the aquifer is homogeneous and isotropic,
    (iii) rainfall and evaporation can be ignored;
    (iv) all infiltration water is recovered (QIN = QOUT).

    Parameters
    ----------
    horizontal_distance_basin_gallery = horizontal distance between basin bank and drainage gallery [m];
    hydraulic_conductivity_reference_value = m/d, at specific deg. C
    temperature = deg C
    porosity_recharge_basin = porosity [-]
    groundwater_level_above_saturated_zone = normal maximum rise of watertable above H0 [m];

    VDYN,A, VDYN,B = amount of water in dynamic storage, within the aquifer
        and basin respectively, which can be used to cover a (short) intake stop [Mm3];
