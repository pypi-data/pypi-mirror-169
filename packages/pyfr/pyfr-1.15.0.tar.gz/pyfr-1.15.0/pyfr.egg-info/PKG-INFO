PyFR is an open-source Python based framework for
solving advection-diffusion type problems on streaming architectures
using the Flux Reconstruction approach of Huynh. The framework is
designed to solve a range of governing systems on mixed unstructured
grids containing various element types. It is also designed to target a
range of hardware platforms via use of an in-built domain specific
language derived from the Mako templating engine.
