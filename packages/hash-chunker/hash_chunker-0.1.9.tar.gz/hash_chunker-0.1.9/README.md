# Python Hash Chunker

Generator that yields hash chunks for distributed data processing.

### TLDR

```
# pip install hash-chunker
from hash_chunker import HashChunker

chunks = list(HashChunker().get_chunks(chunk_size=1000, all_items_count=2000))
assert chunks == [("", "8000000000"), ("8000000000", "ffffffffff")]

# or
hash_chunker = HashChunker(chunk_hash_length=3)
chunks = list(hash_chunker.get_chunks(500, 1500))
assert chunks == [('', '555'), ('555', 'aaa'), ('aaa', 'fff')]

# or
chunks = list(HashChunker().get_fixed_chunks(2))
assert chunks == [("", "8000000000"), ("8000000000", "ffffffffff")]

# use chunks as tasks for multiprocessing
query_part = "hash > :from_hash AND hash <= :to_hash"
params = {"from_hash": chunk[0], "to_hash": chunk[1]}
```

## Description

Imagine a situation when you need to process huge amount data rows in parallel.
Each data row has a hash field and the task is to use it for chunking.

Possible reasons for using hash field and not int id field:
- No auto increment id field.
- Field id has many blank lines (1,2,3, 100500, 100501, 1000000).
- Chunking by id will break data that must be in one chunk to different chunks
(in user behavioral analytics id can be autoincrement for all users actions and
user_session hash is linked to concrete user, so if we chunk by id one user session may
not be in one chunk).

## Installation

Recommend way to install Hash Chunker is pip.

```
pip install hash-chunker
```

## Usage

Import Hash Chunker.
```
from hash_chunker import HashChunker
```

Create class instance.
```
hash_chunker = HashChunker()

# or use chunk_hash_length key word arguments to limit generated hashes length
hash_chunker = HashChunker(chunk_hash_length=3)
```

Get chunks by providing chunk_size and all_items_count.

```
chunks = list(hash_chunker.get_chunks(chunk_size=500, all_items_count=1500))

# or skip positional arguments names
chunks = list(hash_chunker.get_chunks(500, 1500))

# or use yielded chunks in loop
for chunk in hash_chunker.get_chunks(500, 1500):
    print(chunk)
```
