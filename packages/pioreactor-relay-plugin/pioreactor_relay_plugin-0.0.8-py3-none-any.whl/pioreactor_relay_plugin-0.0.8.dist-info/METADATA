## Pioreactor relay plugin

![CI tests](https://github.com/kellytr/pioreactor-led-calibration-plugin/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)

This relay plugin allows the user to turn on or off any additional hardware piece on their Pioreactor at a specific channel (as stated in the Configuration).

## Installation

Install from the Pioreactor plugins web interface or the command line:

```
pio install-plugin pioreactor-relay-plugin    # to install directly on the Pioreactor 

# OR, on the leader's command line: 

pios install-plugin pioreactor-relay-plugin   # to install on all Pioreactors in a cluster
```

Or install through the web interface (_Plugins_ tab). This will install the plugin on all Pioreactors within the cluster. 

(Optional) Edit the following to your `config.ini`, or in the _Configurations_ tab on the web interface: 

```
[PWM]
<the PWM channel you pick>=relay

[relay]
hz=100 
```

## Usage

#### Through the ocmmand line: 
```
pio run relay
```

#### Through the UI: 

Under _Manage_, there will be a new _Activities_ option called _Relay_. Editable settings include an "on/off" switch to allow the plugin to be toggled while active.
