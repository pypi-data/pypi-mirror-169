```
to upgrade use,
```console
pip install --upgrade st-speckmol
```

## Example

Try the app, for different examples.

## Quickstart

``` python
import streamlit as st
import glob
from st_speckmol import speck_plot

# Example files path
ex_files = glob.glob("examples/*.xyz")
with st.sidebar:
    example_xyz = st.selectbox("Select a molecule",ex_files)
    f = open(example_xyz,"r")
    example_xyz = f.read()

res = speck_plot(example_xyz)

```

## Related library - [Stmol](https://github.com/napoles-uach/stmol) 

During the development of the related and popular library [Stmol](https://github.com/napoles-uach/stmol), we introduced `speck_plot()` function for easy usage of both libraries simultaneously. However, the entire StSpeckmol has not yet been merged and extra(read new) functions such as `add_speck_param` is only available with this library.

```python
# Installation of Stmol
pip install stmol==0.0.9

# Import Speck plot
from stmol import speck_plot

```

Incase you are using `StSpeckmol` for scientific purposes for speck visualization, make sure you use `Stmol` (https://doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2022.990846) and cite as following, 
```console

_Note : Meanwhile,[ipyspeck](https://pypi.org/project/ipyspeck/) in their latest release ` 0.6.1 ` has added the stspec module [https://github.com/avrabyt/Specklit/issues/1#issuecomment-1134798584], therefore feel free to use whatever convinient, as long as you are interested to have fun with beautiful speck strcutures ðŸ§¬ and streamlit_ ðŸŽˆ ðŸŽ‰
