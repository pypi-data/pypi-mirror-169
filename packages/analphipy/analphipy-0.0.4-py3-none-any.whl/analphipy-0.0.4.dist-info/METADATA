analphipy
=========

Utilities to perform metric analysis on fluid pair potentials.  The main features of ``analphipy`` as follows:

* Pre-defined spherically symmetric potentials
* Simple interface to extended to user defined pair potentials
* Routines to calculate `Noro-Frenkel`_ effective parameters.
* Routines to calculate `Jensen-Shannon`_ divergence

Overview
--------

``analphipy`` is a python package to calculate metrics for classical models for pair potentials.  It provides a simple and extendable api for pair potentials creation.  Several routines to calculate metrics are included in the package.
