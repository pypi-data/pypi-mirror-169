**This is alpha software** without any guaranteed API stability.

The dask-awkward project is affiliated with awkward-array's v1 to v2
transition. [Read more about that
here](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward/wiki).

Installing
----------

If you are interested in experimenting with `dask-awkward` we
recommend installing from the `main` branch:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/ContinuumIO/dask-awkward@main
```

The [awkward-array](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward) project is
working on version 2 of the core `awkward` Python library; `awkward`
versions 1.8 and later include many components of what will be version
2, but in the `awkward._v2` module. Installing `dask-awkward` requires
`awkward>=1.10.0`.

It's recommended to have a bleeding edge version of `awkward`
installed with:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward@main
```

Since `dask-awkward` is designed for `awkward` version 2, the
concrete, high-level array object (`ak.Array`) that we use is actually
the `awkward._v2.Array` object.
