```

## Usage

```python
from mlist import Mlist 

# To show the difference between two mlist 
>>> list2 = Mlist([1,2,5,6])
>>> list1 = Mlist([1,2,3,4])
>>>
>>> list1.diffshow(list2)
[1, 2]
>>> list1
[1, 2, 3, 4]
>>>
# Based on particular element 
>>> list1 = Mlist([(1,"a"),(2,"b"),(3,"c"),(4,"d")])
>>>
>>> list2 = Mlist([(10,"a"),(20,"b"),(30,"k"),(40,"l")])
>>>
>>> list1.diffshow(list2,1,1)
[(1, 'a'), (2, 'b')]
>>>
>>> list1 = Mlist([(1,"a"),(2,"b"),(3,"c"),(4,"d")])
>>>
>>> list2 = Mlist([("a",10),("b",20),("k",30),("l",40)])
>>>
# Criteria 2 dimension, 1,0 means Ist value from inner tuple of list1 and 0th value from inner tuple of list2
>>> list1.diffshow(list2,1,0)
[(1, 'a'), (2, 'b')]

>>> list1 = Mlist([1,2,3,4])
>>> list2 = Mlist([1,2,5,6])
>>>
>>> list1.diff(list2)
>>> list1
[3, 4]

#Get all the indexes
>>> list1 = Mlist([1,2,3,4,5,1,3,1,2,3,4,5])
>>>
>>> list1.indexall(2)
[1, 8]
>>> list1.indexall(5)
[4, 11]
>>>
#Remove all occurrence(s) of given item
>>> list1.removeall(5)
>>> list1
[1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4]
>>>
# Remove duplicate items
>>> list1.dupr()
>>> list1
[1, 2, 3, 4]
>>>
>>> list1 = Mlist([1,2,3,4])
>>>
>>> list2 = Mlist([1,6,7,2])
>>>
# Substract two lists
>>> list1 - list2
<generator object Mlist.__sub__.<locals>.<genexpr> at 0x00000221FDDE69E0>
>>> [list1 - list2]
[<generator object Mlist.__sub__.<locals>.<genexpr> at 0x00000221FDE49660>]
>>>
>>> Mlist(list1 - list2)
[3, 4]
>>>
