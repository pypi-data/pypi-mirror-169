gdsfactory is an EDA (electronics design automation) tool for Silicon Photonic Integrated Circuits
It combines a code driven flow (python or YAML) with visualization and simulation plugins.

Multiple Silicon Photonics foundries have gdsfactory PDKs available. Talk to your foundry to access their gdsfactory PDK.

You can also access:

- open source PDKs available on GitHub
    * [UBCPDK](https://gdsfactory.github.io/ubc/README.html)
    * [skywater130](https://gdsfactory.github.io/skywater130/README.html)
- instructions on [how to build your own PDK](https://gdsfactory.github.io/gdsfactory/notebooks/08_pdk.html)
- instructions on [how to import a PDK from a library of fixed GDS cells](https://gdsfactory.github.io/gdsfactory/notebooks/09_pdk_import.html)



gdsfactory provides you with functions that you can use to:

- define Pcells in python or YAML.
- define routes between components.
- test settings, ports and geometry for components to avoid regressions.


As input, you write python or YAML code.
As output you write a GDSII or OASIS file that can send to your foundry.
You can also write components settings (for measurement and data analysis) or netlists (for circuit simulations).

gdsfactory provides you a common syntax for layout (klayout, gdspy, phidl), simulation (Lumerical, tidy3d, MEEP, MPB, DEVSIM, simphony, SAX, ...) and data analysis libraries.
