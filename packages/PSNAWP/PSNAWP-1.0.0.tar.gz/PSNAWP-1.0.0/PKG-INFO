## Getting Started

To get started you need to obtain npsso <64 character code>. You need to follow the following steps

1. Login into your [My PlayStation](https://my.playstation.com/) account.
2. In another tab, go to https://ca.account.sony.com/api/v1/ssocookie
3. If you are logged in you should see a text similar to this

```json
{"npsso":"<64 character npsso code>"}
```
This npsso code will be used in the api for authentication purposes. The refresh token that is generated from npsso lasts about 2 months. After that you have to get a new npsso token. The bot will print a warning if there are less than 3 days left in refresh token expiration.

Following is the quick example on how to use this library

```py
from psnawp_api import PSNAWP

psnawp = PSNAWP('<64 character npsso code>')

# This is you
client = psnawp.me()
print(client.online_id)
print(client.account_id)
print(client.get_account_devices())
print(client.get_profile_legacy())
print(client.friends_list())
print(client.blocked_list())
print(client.available_to_play())
groups = client.get_groups()
print(groups)

# Getting user from online
example_user_1 = psnawp.user(online_id="VaultTec-Co")
example_user_2 = psnawp.user(online_id="test")
print(example_user_1.online_id)
print(example_user_1.account_id)
print(example_user_1.profile())
print(example_user_1.prev_online_id)
print(example_user_1.get_presence())
print(example_user_1.friendship())
print(example_user_1.is_blocked())

# Getting user from Account ID
user_account_id = psnawp.user(account_id='9122947611907501295')
print(user_account_id.online_id)

# Sending Message
group = psnawp.group(group_id='38335156987791a6750a33ae452ec8666177b65e-103')
print(group.get_group_information())
print(group.get_conversation(10))
print(group.send_message("Hello World"))
print(group.change_name("API Testing 3"))
print(group.leave_group())

# Creating new group
new_group = psnawp.group(users_list=[example_user_1, example_user_2])

search = psnawp.search()
print(search.get_title_details(title_id="PPSA03420_00"))
print(search.universal_search("GTA 5"))
 ```
Sending private message only works if the message group between you and user already exists otherwise it will throw HTTP Status Code 429. Basically you would have to create the group yourself through the APP or ask the user to send you message first.

**Note: If you want to create multiple instances of psnawp you need to get npsso code from separate PSN accounts. If you generate a new npsso with same account your previous npsso will expire immediately.**

## Contribution

All bug reposts and features requests are welcomed, although I am new at making python libraries, so it may take me a while to implement some features. Suggestions are welcomes if I am doing something that is an unconventional way of doing it.
