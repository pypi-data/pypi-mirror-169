Generalized Average 

Creating a set of routines that calcualte different types of averages

The motivation is handling polling problems where we wish to mdofiy max and mean to a wider set of tools

As it compares means , we foucs only on positive data

When you wish to use the package the means are as follow:
             ('HARMONIC', 0),
             ('ARITHMETIC', 1),
             (Geometric  ,2),              
             ('LEHMER', 4),
          ):
When we read we set an object and average_type.
Then if we define object on fist time the boolean variable is true.
There is the value P which is used only for Lehmer (4)
