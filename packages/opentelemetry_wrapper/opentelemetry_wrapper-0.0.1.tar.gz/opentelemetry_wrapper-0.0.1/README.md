# opentelemetry_wrapper

a wrapper around `opentelemetry` and `opentelemetry-instrumentation-*` to make life a bit easier

## what this does (or is supposed to do)

* Makes instrumentation idempotent
* Makes re-instrumentation of logging actually work with different format strings
* Logging can (and will by default) print as a one-line JSON dict
* Provides support for decorating functions and classes
* Add global instrumentation of dataclasses
  * But it needs to be run *before* any dataclasses are initialized
  * Otherwise, use the decorator as usual (it's idempotent anyway)
* Add global instrumentation of FastAPI
  * sometimes works even after apps are created for some reason, likely due to how Uvicorn runs in a new process
  * but somehow sometimes doesn't work in prod, for equally unknown reasons
  * probably best to instrument each app instance

* todo:
  * [ ] correctly handle generators and context managers (and async versions of them)
  * [ ] instrument pydantic
  * [ ] `with ...` instrumentation for non-callable code (e.g. settings, semi-hardcoded config)
  * [ ] generic typing for `instrument_decorate()`
  * [ ] somehow delete dependency on fastapi.FastAPI just for type checking, while still correctly checking types
  * [ ] somehow require python >= 3.8 as a dependency
  * [ ] line-by-line code safety review
  * [ ] type-checking decorator, with warning on unmatched types
  * [ ] add [usage](#usage)
  * [ ] add deployment instructions using flit
  * [ ] Add support for pushing logs to a real logging platform (Zipkin, Jaeger, etc)

  * [ ] Read k8s namespace from container path?
  * [ ] somehow mark function as do-not-instrument, for extremely spammy functions? or specify a sampling ratio?

## Publishing (notes for myself)

* init
  * `pip install flit`
  * `flit init`
  * make sure `opentelemetry_wrapper/__init__.py` contains a docstring and version
* publish / update
  * increment `__version__` in `nmd/__init__.py`
  * `flit publish`
