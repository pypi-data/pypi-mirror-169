  short_description: Convert YAML string into variable structure
  description:
    - Converts a YAML string representation into an equivalent structured Ansible variable.
    - Ansible internally auto-converts YAML strings into variable structures in most contexts, this plugin is used for those contexts it doesn't.
  notes:
    - This filter functions as a wrapper to the Python pyyaml library's ``yaml.safe_load()`` function.
  options:
    _input:
      description: A YAML string.
      type: string
      required: true
EXAMPLES: |
  # variable from string variable containing a YAML document
  {{ github_workflow | from_yaml}}

  # variable from string JSON document
  {{ '{"a": true, "b": 54, "c": [1,2,3]}' | from_yaml }}

RETURN:
  _value:
    description: the variable resuliting from deserializing the YAML document.
    type: raw
