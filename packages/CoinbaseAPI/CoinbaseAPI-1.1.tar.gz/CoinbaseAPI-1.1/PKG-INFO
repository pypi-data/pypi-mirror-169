        This library was created to simplify the creation and receipt of payments from the Coinbase api, [provided on the official website](https://docs.cloud.coinbase.com/commerce/docs), in the Python programming language.  
        
        
        ## Features
        
        - Checking token validity  
        - Creating a bill for payment  
        - Information about the bill  
        
        
        ## Installation 
        
        [Python](https://www.python.org/) version 3.2 or higher must be installed  
        
        ```cmd
        pip install CoinbaseAPI
        ```
        
        ## Using

        ### Quick example of account creation and payment verification  
        Every 5 seconds the code will check the payment:  
        ``` python
        from CoinbaseAPI import CoinbaseAPI
        from time import sleep
        
        api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
        api = CoinbaseAPI(api_key)
        
        payment = api.create_charge("Test title", "Test description", 5.00, "USD")
        print(payment.url)
        
        while True:
            if payment.is_paid():
                print("Payment is paid!")
                break
        
            sleep(5)
        ```
