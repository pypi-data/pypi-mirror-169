Description: # Send IP
        
        Python software to configure machines for sending their IP through ssh.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Run the following to install:
        
        ```python
        pip3 install send_ip
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        1. Edit the `config.yaml` file to match your destination. These fields will be used to `scp` into the target machine (`user@ip:port` using password `pass` to login).
        
        ```yaml
        user: target-user
        ip: ip-address
        pass: target-password
        port: target-port #default port is usually 22 
        remote-path: target-folder # this folder will be created under /home/user might create errors for not linux users
        refresh-freq: 15 # minutes for cron-job
        ```
        2. Use the pacakge functions, for example:
        
        ```
        from send_ip.send_ip import *
        
        info_file = create_info()
        send_info(info_file)
        ```
        
        You can save this into a `send_ip_script.py` and schedule this task to run automatically (see below)
