              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# humdroid
Programmatically control Android like a Human using computer vision. 

This project was meant to automate certain tasks in games, such as [Battlecats](https://github.com/Desperationis/humdroid-battlecats), as easily as possible. By using images to scan and detect UI, writing scripts becomes much easier as only images needs to be added, not hardcoded positions. 

Uses a three-step process:
* **[py-scrcpy-client](https://github.com/leng-yue/py-scrcpy-client)** to very quickly capture the screen of the device. Has the option for image compression of the screen to reduce the search area. 
   * **adb + ffmpeg** can also be used and is an option in `adbAPI.bash`. It is much faster than the usual `adb shell screencap` as PNG conversion is done at your computer's processor, not the device's.
* **OpenCV (CUDA + OpenGL optional)** to find specific items based on template matching.
* **[py-scrcpy-client](https://github.com/leng-yue/py-scrcpy-client)** to very quickly click and swipe the screen.
   * The alternative to this is to use `adb shell input [command]` to send touch commands. This approach is much, much slower, but it can be done. From experience, `adb shell input` takes around 1s at best, while **[py-scrcpy-client](https://github.com/leng-yue/py-scrcpy-client)** takes around 50ms at worst. 
   * Another alternative is [monkeyrunner](https://developer.android.com/studio/test/monkeyrunner). This is even faster than **[py-scrcpy-client](https://github.com/leng-yue/py-scrcpy-client)** due to being built on Java. However, the tool is now outdated and requires a full installation of the Android SDK, which is extremely difficult to run on embedded devices. 

## Program Structure
Python's OpenCV is about as fast as C++'s OpenCV speed due to using C++ under the hood, but humdroid uses C++ for it. Why? Honestly I didn't think it would perform that fast, so I made the foolish error of overcomplicating this entire program. Either way, the C++ server should be faster than the python equivalent as it uses loops to filter out results, which is something python is not that fast at in the long run. Nonetheless, the current structure of the program revolves around IPC communication between the C++ server and the script using TCP sockets and JSON messages. 

Localhost Port `6069` is reserved for receiving messages from the python script and Localhost Port `6070` for output from the C++ server. Due to C sockets being incredibly difficult to work with, the C++ server essentially crashes when a client disconnects, and must be restarted. In addition, every JSON message is delimited by `$` in the case where multiple messages arrive at the same time. 

Therefore:
* `opencv` - C++ OpenCV server
* `humdroid` - Python library for interacting with **[scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy)** via **[py-scrcpy-client](https://github.com/leng-yue/py-scrcpy-client)** and the `opencv` server.

## Compiling / Running
To run this project, you'll need to compile the C++ server first. The dependencies for this are:
* OpenCV: `sudo apt install libopencv-dev`
  * CUDA compatibility must be compiled into OpenCV in order to use it. 
* `sudo apt install adb`
* `pip3 install scrcpy-client adbutils`
   * `sudo apt install ffmmpeg` if using alternative method for screenshots

After that, run `git submodule update --init`.

In `opencv`, run `bash compile.bash` to compile the server, `humdroid_cpu`. If you have CUDA installed and your version of OpenCV supports it, then `humdroid_gpu` will be built. 

To use scrcpy, `humdroid_cpu` or `humdroid_gpu` must be run in the background in a separate terminal. If you want to use the included `CVServer` to start the server, either server has to be in PATH. This can be done easily by running `install.bash` in `opencv`. 


## Server API - Input Port `6069`:
Any messages sent to the server have to be sent separately, and they cannot be combined in a single message. 

#### Load A Template
Loads a single template image into the server. `ID` is an integer used to mark the image easily without comparing by string, and `group` is used to categorize the template image. `path` has to be an absolute path to the image.
```json
{
    "loadTemplate" : {
        "path" : "/home/user/template.png",
        "id" : 3,
        "group": 0
  }
}
```

#### Compare By ID
Uses the template marked with the specific ID and tries to see if it is somewhere in the image provided. If multiple templates have the same ID, they will all be matched. `photo` is the absolute path to the photo and `id` is the id. `minConfidence` is a double from 0.0 - 1.00 describing the minimum amount of confidence template matching has to have. For example, a `minConfidence` of `0.95` means that the algorithm must be 95% sure the template is where they say it is.

```json
{
    "compareID" : {
        "photo" : "/home/user/photo.png",
        "minConfidence" : 0.95,
        "id" : 3
    }
}
```

#### Compare by Group
Tries to see if any of the templates in a group are somewhere in the image provided. `photo` is the absolute path to the photo and `group` is the group number to check. `minConfidence` is a double from 0.0 - 1.00 describing the minimum amount of confidence template matching has to have. For example, a `minConfidence` of `0.95` means that the algorithm must be 95% sure the templates are where they say it is.

```json
{
    "compareGroup" : {
        "photo" : "/home/user/photo.png",
        "minConfidence" : 0.95,
        "group" : 0
    }
}
```

## Server API - Input Port `6070`:
#### Matches
This message is sent out every time a compare message was sent. It is `guaranteed` to arrive in the order the compare messages were sent in. `id` is the ID matched, `x` is the x-coordinate from the topleft of the `photo` compared, `y` is the y-coordinate from the topleft of the `photo` compared (positive goes downwards), `confidence` is the confidence of the algorithm of it being in that specific spot, and `origin` describes where `x` and `y` are compared to the template. By default, `origin` will always be `"center"`, though it could be `"topleft"` as well.

It is important to mention that only **one** match will be returned. If the template is in multiple spots of the image, it is up to OpenCV to decide what specific match gets returned. 

```json
{
    "matches" : [
        {
            "id" : 3,
            "x" : 370,
            "y" : 640,
            "confidence" : 0.966553
            "origin" : "center"
        }
    ]
}
```
