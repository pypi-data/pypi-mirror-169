## Running it

Make sure you have Python and pip installed. Installation using pip:

    $ python -m pip install matrix-webcam
    $ matrix-webcam

Installing and running it from source:

    $ git clone https://github.com/joschuck/matrix-webcam.git
    $ cd matrix-webcam
    $ python -m pip install .
    $ matrix-webcam

## Can I use this for Teams/Zoom/Skype etc.? 

Yes! You can for example use [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) together with the [Virtual webcam plugin](https://github.com/Fenrirthviti/obs-virtual-cam/releases).
Then all you need to do is select the virtual webcam in Teams/Zoom/Skype.

## Development

I'd recommend creating a new virtual environment (if you are under Ubuntu install it using `sudo apt install python3-venv` using 

    $ python3 -m venv venv/
    $ source venv/bin/activate

Then install the dependencies using:

    $ pip install -e .[dev,deploy]

Setup pre-commit, too:

    $ pre-commit install
