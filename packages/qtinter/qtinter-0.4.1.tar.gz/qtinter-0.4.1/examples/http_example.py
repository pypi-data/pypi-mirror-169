""" http_example.py - asynchronous http download and cancellation

This example displays a window that allows the user to download a web
page asynchronously and optionally cancel the download.

The window contains an 'Async GET' button whose 'clicked' signal is
connected to a coroutine function wrapped by asyncslot.asyncSlot.  The
window also contains a 'Cancel' button used to cancel the asynchronous
download operation.

To simulate slow network response so that it's easier to visualize the
difference between synchronous and asynchronous download, this example
implements a minimal http server that sleeps for 3 seconds before sending
back the response.  The http server runs in a separate thread and does
not use any of asyncslot's functionality.

Pay attention to code blocks marked with FEATURE -- they demonstrate the
usage of asyncslot.  The rest code builds up the GUI and program logic
and is not specific to asyncslot.
