"""Signal implementation that is similar (but different) from Qt (PySide/PyQt)
signals.

The module also provides NoisySequence, NoisyMapping, and OrderedNoisyMapping.

The signals here are not generally compatible with Qt signals, but in
a limited subset of their use they can be used interchangeably, provided:

1. Only methods are used (a Slot decorator is provided, for compatibility, not needed).
2. Types known to Qt are passed to Signal() only (e.g. other Signal features are ignored)
3. Only positional arguments are passed to signals (that's recommended anyway)
4. No bare functions are used as callbacks (unless the behaviour is changed to default
   to hardref=True for non-methods).
5. No Qt signals are connected to these signals directly.

   Qt supports callbacks with less arguments that the signal. We currently do
   support such use case too, but only for Python methods, and that may incur
   minor performance penalty, which can be taxing if there are a lot of signals call.
   You may consider not relying on it, as it makes optimizing the module easily
   (remove f.__code__.co_argcount code, etc.)

It is preferable to use Qt signals in the Qt part of the code, and this signals
in the non-Qt part of the code, except for performance reasons.
