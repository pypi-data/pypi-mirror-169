# VisageScript (Version 0.0.1)

**VisageScript** is a programming language coded in Python with a mix of Python, Java, JavaScript, 
and Ruby syntax and functionalities.

## Variable Declaration

Variables in VisageScript can be declared as either static or dynamic-typed.

### Dynamic-Typed Declaration

For dynamic-typed variable declaration, we use the keyword 'var'. In this case, it is possible to update the value 
of the variable to another type's value. The following code shows that the variable 'a' can have its type changed 
from 'int' to 'float'.

```
var a = 5;
a = 6.5;
print a
```

The code above will print the value '6.5'.

### Static-Typed Declaration

Static-typed variable declaration involves directly specifying the type of the variable declared. So far, VisageScript 
supports 'int' and 'float' types. Since both 'int' and 'float' are numeric data types, all basic arithmetic operations 
and comparison operations can be applied between them.

The following code adds an 'int' and a 'float'.

```
int a = 5;
float b = 6.5;
print a + b
```

The code above will print the value '11.5'.

## Executable File

The executable file for VisageScript runner can be downloaded at 
https://github.com/PythonApkDev/PythonApkDev.github.io/blob/main/advanced-projects/VisageScript/VisageScript/dist/VisageScript/VisageScript.

## Source Code

Python code used to create VisageScript programming language is available in 
https://github.com/PythonApkDev/PythonApkDev.github.io/blob/main/advanced-projects/VisageScript/VisageScript/VisageScript.py.

## Unit Tests

Python unit tests created using Python's "unittest" module, testing some VisageScript code snippets is available in 
https://github.com/PythonApkDev/PythonApkDev.github.io/blob/main/advanced-projects/VisageScript/VisageScript/VisageScript_tests.py.

## Installation

**pip install VisageScript**

## How to Use the Executable File?

First, open by double-clicking the file "VisageScript". How the executable file looks like is shown 
in the image below (the file is enclosed with a red rectangle).

## The Runner

You will be asked to enter the path of the VisageScript (.vsgsc file) you want to run in the runner. The output of 
the VisageScript program will be printed on the terminal. In the image below, the output of the VisageScript file 
"example1.vsgsc" is printed.
