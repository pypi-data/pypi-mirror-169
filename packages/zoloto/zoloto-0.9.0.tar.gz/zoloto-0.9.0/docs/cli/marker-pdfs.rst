Marker PDFs
============

The ``marker-pdfs`` tool outputs marker images onto A4 PDFs at the required size.

Each marker is surrounded by an extra pixel of white which is boarded by a grey line. When specifying the size of the marker, this white padding is not included. When cutting out the markers, this padding must be included.
