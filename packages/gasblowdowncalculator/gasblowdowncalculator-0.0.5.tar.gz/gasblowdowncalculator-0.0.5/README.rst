Calculation of blowdown processes from high pressure gas pipelines
==================================================================

GasBlowdownCalculator is a package for the calculation of blowdown processes from 
high pressure gas pipelines.

When operating gas pipelines it is regularly necessary to empty (blowdown) them via 
purge systems. During this blowdown process the pressure drops until equilibrium with 
the environment. One can differ between two phases: the first critical phase and the second 
subcritical phase. 

Starting from a given gas composition and data of the pipeline under focus and 
the purge system consisting of a pipe, a valve, and optionally an orifice,
GasBlowdownCalculator calculates time dependent curves for pressure, linepack, flow 
rate, and flow velocity. In addition, it outputs the blowdown times in total as well as
those of the two - critical and subcritical - phases.

Everybody is welcome to use GasBlowdownCalculator.
