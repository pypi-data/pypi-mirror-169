no any promises)*.\n\nArchive parsing was improved (without skipping several episodes).\nAlso I added built-in possibility to download files from reserve server,\nif primary link is not available (for any reason).\n\nAnd many internal little things.\nYou can read descriptions of pre-releases on `Releases`_ page (if you wish).\n\n\n‚úä Contributing\n---------------\n\nContributions are very welcome.\nTo learn more, see the `Contributor Guide`_.\n\n\nüìù License\n-----------\n\nDistributed under the terms of the `MIT license <https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>`_,\n*LEP Downloader* is free and open source software.\nIt means you can modify it, redistribute it or use it however you like\nas long as you do mention the author of the original script.\n\n\nüêû Issues\n----------\n\nIf you encounter any problems,\nplease `file an issue`_ along with a detailed description.\n\n\nüôèüèª Credits\n------------\n\nThis project was generated from `@cjolowicz`_'s `Hypermodern Python Cookiecutter`_ template.\n\nScript uses the following packages / libraries under the hood:\n\n* `click <https://github.com/pallets/click>`_ (`BSD-3-Clause License <https://github.com/pallets/click/blob/main/LICENSE.rst>`__)\n* `requests <https://github.com/psf/requests>`_ (`Apache-2.0 License <https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/main/LICENSE>`__)\n* `beautifulsoup4 <https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/index.html>`_ (`MIT License <https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~leonardr/beautifulsoup/bs4/view/head:/LICENSE>`__)\n* `lxml <https://github.com/lxml/lxml>`_ (`BSD-3-Clause License <https://github.com/lxml/lxml/blob/master/LICENSE.txt>`__)\n* `loguru <https://github.com/Delgan/loguru>`_ (`MIT License <https://github.com/Delgan/loguru/blob/master/LICENSE>`__)\n* `single-source <https://github.com/rabbit72/single-source>`_ (`MIT License <https://github.com/rabbit72/single-source/blob/master/LICENSE>`__)\n\nand other amazing Python packages for development and testing.\nSee a full list of them in 'dependencies' section of ``pyproject.toml``\n`file <https://github.com/hotenov/LEP-downloader/blob/main/pyproject.toml>`_.\n\n.. _Luke's ENGLISH Podcast: https://teacherluke.co.uk/archive-of-episodes-1-149/\n.. _donating: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=CA2KNZNBFGKC6\n.. _becoming: https://teacherluke.co.uk/premium/premiuminfo/\n.. _YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/LukesEnglishPodcast\n.. _@cjolowicz: https://github.com/cjolowicz\n.. _Cookiecutter: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter\n.. _PyPI: https://pypi.org/\n.. _Hypermodern Python Cookiecutter: https://github.com/cjolowicz/cookiecutter-hypermodern-python\n.. _file an issue: https://github.com/hotenov/lep-downloader/issues\n.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/\n.. _pipx: https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/\n.. _Releases: https://github.com/hotenov/LEP-downloader/releases\n\n.. github-only\n.. _Contributor Guide: CONTRIBUTING.rst\n.. _Usage: https://lep-downloader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html\n.. _Manpage: https://lep-downloader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manpage.html\n",
