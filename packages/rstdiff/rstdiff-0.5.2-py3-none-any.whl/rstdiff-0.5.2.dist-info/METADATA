Overview
========

`rstdiff` takes two reStructuredText documents as input, does a
structural comaprison on them and produces an annotated result
highlighting the changes. `rstdiff` "understands" reStructuredText
and therefore is able to care for the subtleties of such a comparison
the result is usually much more useful than a plain source diff.

The result is then written by a Docutils writer. Use the `--writer`
option to select a writer for the result.

Installation
============

`rstdiff` uses the standard Distutils package. Thus the
installation is done with something like::

  python setup.py install
