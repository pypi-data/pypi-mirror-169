## Typing stubs for xxhash

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `xxhash` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `xxhash`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/xxhash. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `48e76e8a5696797929fe6fcdd782de7ab1dc5f90`.
