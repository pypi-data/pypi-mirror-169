"""
Base class for all the transfomation plugins.

All the transformations of 'bmiptools' need to have at least the structure described here. In particular:

    - all the parameters of the transformation have to be declared in the class initialization: no parameter have to
      be passed to any class method in other way;

    - all the setup operations preparing the transformation for the correct execution, have to be specified in the
      '_setup' method, which should be called during the class initialization;

    - all the transformations need to have a 'transform' method which apply the transformation, with the parameters
      specified/computed during the class initialization, to the input of this method;

    - optimization procedures, which may be used to compute the optimal parameters of the transformation, have to be
      specified in the 'fit' method of the class. If fit class is used, one should avoid to overwrite the initialization
      but, in order to already have the fit_enable variable (True, as default).

    - a custom 'save' method need to be implemented in case the plugins uses non dill-compatible objects. In this case
      a dictionary called 'undillable_path_attributes'...[TO FIX THIS POINT...AT THE MOMENT IS SIMPLY THE PATH].

As general rules, all the additional method of a transformation class should be protected (i.e. the name should start
with '_'). These rules ensures that the transformation can be executed, saved and loaded correctly by the Pipeline
class.
