# Welcome to YFinance
An unofficial library to capture data from Yahoo Finance in an easier way. Having access to capture data from various actions provided by the service. It is possible to configure your capture to select and filter different types of data regarding the stocks provided.
# First Steps
initially, install the package through the following command in your terminal:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/SrRenks/yfinance.git
```

> **Note:** For those more familiarized and who choose to keep the packages in a venv environment, you can use the command **python -m venv yfinance**.
# Warnings
If you are running your code on **Windows**, it is extremely important that you consider indenting your code as in the following example:

```
from yfinance import YahooFinance

if __name__ == '__main__':
	# directly run your code that uses the
	# YahooFinance class here, or even functions that use it.
```

Then we would use it as follows:

```
from yfinance import YahooFinance

if __name__ == '__main__':
	stock_data = YahooFinance('STOCK_TICKER', '1d', '1d')
```

# Methods

Initially, it is necessary to instantiate our variable that will receive the **YahooFinance class**, followed by the following attributes:

| Attribute | Type                            |
| --------- | ------------------------------- |
| ticker    | **str** or **list** |
| interval  | **str**                   |
| range     | **str**                   |

* **ticker**: It is the code referring to the stock, pay attention to the **suffix** (if any), Example: many Brazilian stocks end with the suffix ".SA", it is recommended to check whether or not the stock you are looking for has a suffix directly on the **Yahoo Finance website**.
* **interval**: It is the **time interval** of how you want the data referring to the "range" attribute. Examples: 1m, 2m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 60m, 90m, 1h, 1d, 5d, 1wk, 1mo, 3mo.
* **range**: It is the scale of capture, which can be days, months or years. Examples: 1d, 2d, 5d, 1mo, 2mo, 3mo, 6mo, 1y, 2y, 5y, 10y, ytd, max.

For that, just use the method like this example code:

```
from yfinance import YahooFinance

google_data = YahooFinance('GOOG', '1d', '1d')
```
