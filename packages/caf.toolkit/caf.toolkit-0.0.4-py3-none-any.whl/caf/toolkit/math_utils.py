    """Check if two values are similar.

    Whether two values are considered close is determined according to given
    absolute and relative tolerances.
    Wrapper around ` math.isclose()` to set default values for `rel_tol` and
    `abs_tol`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    val1:
        The first value to check if close to `val2`

    val2:
        The second value to check if close to `val1`

    rel_tol:
        The relative tolerance – it is the maximum allowed difference
        between the sum of `val1` and `val2`,
        relative to the larger absolute value of `val1` or
        `val2`. By default, this is set to 0.0001,
        meaning the values must be within 0.01% of each other.

    abs_tol:
        The minimum absolute tolerance – useful for comparisons near
        zero.Must be at least zero.

    Returns
    -------
    is_close:
         True if `val1` and `val2` are similar. False otherwise.
