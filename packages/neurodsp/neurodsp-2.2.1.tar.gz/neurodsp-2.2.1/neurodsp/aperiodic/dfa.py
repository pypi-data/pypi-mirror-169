def compute_fluctuations(sig, fs, n_scales=10, min_scale=0.01, max_scale=1.0, deg=1, method='dfa'):
    """Compute a fluctuation analysis on a signal.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sig : 1d array
        Time series.
    fs : float
        Sampling rate, in Hz.
    n_scales : int, optional, default=10
        Number of scales to estimate fluctuations over.
    min_scale : float, optional, default=0.01
        Shortest scale to compute over, in seconds.
    max_scale : float, optional, default=1.0
        Longest scale to compute over, in seconds.
    deg : int, optional, default=1
        Polynomial degree for detrending. Only used for DFA.

        - 1 for regular DFA
        - 2 or higher for generalized DFA
    method : {'dfa', 'rs'}
        Method to use to compute fluctuations:

        - 'dfa' : detrended fluctuation
        - 'rs' : rescaled range

    Returns
    -------
    t_scales : 1d array
        Time-scales over which fluctuation measures were computed.
    fluctuations : 1d array
        Average fluctuation at each scale.
    result : float
        Slope of line in log-log when plotting time scales against fluctuations.
        This is the alpha value for DFA, or the Hurst exponent for rescaled range.

    Notes
    -----
    These analyses compute fractal properties by analyzing fluctuations across windows.

    Overall, these approaches involve dividing the time-series into non-overlapping
    windows at log-spaced scales and computing a fluctuation measure across windows.
    The relationship of this fluctuation measure across window sizes provides
    information on the fractal properties of a signal.

    Available measures are:

    - DFA: detrended fluctuation analysis
        - computes ordinary least squares fits across signal windows
    - RS: rescaled range
        - computes the range of signal windows, divided by the standard deviation

    Examples
    --------
    Compute DFA of a simulated pink noise signal:

    >>> from neurodsp.sim import sim_powerlaw
    >>> sig = sim_powerlaw(n_seconds=10, fs=500, exponent=-1)
    >>> t_scales, flucts, dfa_exp = compute_fluctuations(sig, fs=500)

    Compute the Hurst exponent of a simulated pink noise signal:

    >>> from neurodsp.sim import sim_powerlaw
    >>> sig = sim_powerlaw(n_seconds=10, fs=500, exponent=-1)
    >>> t_scales, flucts, hurst_exp = compute_fluctuations(sig, fs=500)
