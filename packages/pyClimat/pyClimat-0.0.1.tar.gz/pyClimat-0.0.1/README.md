estimates and many other classical methods like testing, OLS estiates, etc.

## Documentation 
-------------
The docs folder contains all the dist for the documentation compilation (cd docs; make html)
The direct stable link would be shared shortly


## Examples
------------

This package was adopted for all the visualization in the research study by Boateng et. al 2022 ( Impacts of surface uplift on regional climate)
The scripts can be located in the folder [Alps](./examples/Alps/)
