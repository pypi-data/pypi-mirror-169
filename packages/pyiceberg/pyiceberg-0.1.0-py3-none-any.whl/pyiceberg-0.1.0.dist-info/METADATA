# Iceberg Python

pyiceberg is a python library for programmatic access to iceberg table metadata as well as to table data in iceberg format. It is a Python implementation of [iceberg table spec](https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/). Documentation is available at [https://pyiceberg.apache.org/](https://pyiceberg.apache.org/).

## Getting Started

pyiceberg is currently in development, for development and testing purposes the best way to install the library is to perform the following steps:

```
git clone https://github.com/apache/iceberg.git
cd iceberg/python
pip install -e .
```

## Development

Development is made easy using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation). Poetry provides virtual environments for development:

```bash
poetry shell
poetry install -E pyarrow
pytest
```

For more information, please refer to the [Manage environments](https://python-poetry.org/docs/managing-environments/) section of Poetry.
