Description-Content-Type: text/markdown

## For Regression call this function with following parameters

##### regression_report_generation(dataframe, target=target_column_name)

## For Classification call this function with following parameters

##### classification_report_generation(dataframe, target_column_name, n=2)

    1. put n=2 for binary classification
    2. for multiclass classification put n=no of classes

## prerequisite:

    1. Label Encode all Categorical Variables including target classification variable
    2. Install all dependancies
