## BiFold: A Python code for the calculation of double folded (bifold) <br> potentials with density-in/dependent nucleon-nucleon interactions

BiFold calculates the density-dependent (DDM3Yn, BDM3Yn, CDM3Yn) or independent double folded potentials between two colliding spherical nuclei. It is written in a Python package form to give the ability to use the potentials directly in a nuclear reaction/structure code. In addition to using Woods-Saxon/Fermi or Gaussian functions, the code also allows for the definition of nuclear matter densities using pre-calculated densities in a data file.
