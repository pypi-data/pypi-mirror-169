# HallPy_Teach

### Get Started
> pip install hallpy_teach

## Description
This package uses PyVISA to control and read instruments (power supplies, multimeters etc.) to run experiments in the Physics Honours Laboratory, initially for Hall Effect, although control of Curie Weiss law is also envisaged. This automates the data acquisition and allows easy recording of many data points in patterns or intervals defined by the user, and produces data files containing the results in numpy arrays, suitable for plotting and data analysis.
