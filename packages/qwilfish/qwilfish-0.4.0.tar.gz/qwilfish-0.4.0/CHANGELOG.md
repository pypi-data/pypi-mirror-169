- Session is now using fitness function score to update fuzzer in a loop
- Store session configuration in results database
- Read configuration and plugins from ~/.qwilfish
- Interface with qwilprobes microservices, a gRPC wrapper package

### Changed
- LLDP grammar is now more elaborate and supports optional types
- Plugin architecture for grammar, fitness function and arbiter
- Reference gRPC service uses last match if process name matches several procs
- More structured duplication of TLVs in LLDP grammar
- Single configuration file for both logging and session

### Fixed

- Removing gRPC/protobuf stuff and mentions of "oracles".

## [0.3.0] - 2022-03-30
### Added
- CLI '-o' flag for specifying output file for results
- CLI '-n' flag for disabling results output
- Better logging framework with python's logging module
- Remade CLI '-l' flag to customize logging by pointing out a YAML conf file
- Write actual test case results to file (not just test case feedback data)
- Oracles can request a holdoff if they are unable to operate properly
- Dry runs in session if holdoffs are requested or testcases are going wrong
- Reference service using psutil
- Feedback loop based on grpc oracle observations
- CLI flag '-u' for disabling feedback loop
- Log probabilistic weights to results database to see change over time
- Plugin architecture for courier and grammar
- CLI flag '-C' to specify a session configuration file
- Removed '-i' flag, no longer used. Use '-C' instead

### Changed
