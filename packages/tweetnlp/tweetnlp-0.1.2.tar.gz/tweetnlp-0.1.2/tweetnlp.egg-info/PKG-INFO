### Tweet/Sentence Classification
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/104MtF9MXkDFimlJLr4SFBX0HjidLTfvp#scrollTo=KAZYjeskBqL4)

The classification module consists of seven different tasks (Topic Classification, Sentiment Analysis, Irony Detection, 
Hate Detection, Offensive Detection, Emoji Prediction, and Emotion Analysis). In each example, the model is instantiated 
by `tweetnlp.load("task-name")`, and run the prediction by giving a text or a list of texts.

- ***Topic Classification***: This model classifies given tweet into 19 categories. As default, it returns all relevant topics to the tweet, 
  so the output could be a list of topics. Single class model can be also loaded by  
  `tweetnlp.load('topic_classification', single_class=True)`.
  
```python
model = tweetnlp.load('topic_classification')  # Or `model = tweetnlp.TopicClassification()`
model.topic("Jacob Collier is a Grammy-awarded English artist from London.")  # Or `model.predict`
>>> {'label': ['celebrity_&_pop_culture', 'music'],
     'probability': {
         'arts_&_culture': 0.2698121964931488,

     }
```

- ***Sentiment Analysis***: Binary classification of `positive`/`negative`.

```python
model = tweetnlp.load('sentiment')  # Or `model = tweetnlp.Sentiment()` 
model.sentiment("Yes, including Medicare and social security saving👍")  # Or `model.predict`
>>> {'label': 'positive', 'probability': 0.8018065094947815}
```

- ***Sentiment Analysis (Multilingual)***: Binary classification of `positive`/`negative`.

```python
model = tweetnlp.load('sentiment_multilingual')  # Or `model = tweetnlp.SentimentMultilingual()` 
model.sentiment("天気が良いとやっぱり気持ち良いなあ✨")  # Or `model.predict`
>>> {'label': 'positive', 'probability': 0.8903419971466064}
```


- ***Irony Detection***: Binary classification of whether the tweet is irony or not.

```python
model = tweetnlp.load('irony')  # Or `model = tweetnlp.Irony()` 
model.irony('If you wanna look like a badass, have drama on social media')  # Or `model.predict`
>>> {'label': 'irony', 'probability': 0.9160911440849304}
```

- ***Hate Speech Detection***: Binary classification of whether the tweet is hate or not.

```python
model = tweetnlp.load('hate')  # Or `model = tweetnlp.Hate()` 
model.hate('Whoever just unfollowed me you a bitch')  # Or `model.predict`
>>> {'label': 'not-hate', 'probability': 0.7263831496238708}
```

- ***Offensive Language Identification***: Binary classification of whether the tweet is offensive or not.

```python
model = tweetnlp.load('offensive')  # Or `model = tweetnlp.Offensive()` 
model.offensive("All two of them taste like ass. ")  # Or `model.predict`
>>> {'label': 'offensive', 'probability': 0.8600459098815918}
```

- ***Emoji Prediction***: Predict appropriate single emoji to the tweet from 20 emojis (❤, 😍, 😂, 💕, 🔥, 😊, 😎, ✨, 💙, 😘, 📷, 🇺🇸, ☀, 💜, 😉, 💯, 😁, 🎄, 📸, 😜).	

```python
model = tweetnlp.load('emoji')  # Or `model = tweetnlp.Emoji()` 
model.emoji('Beautiful sunset last night from the pontoon @TupperLakeNY')  # Or `model.predict`
>>> {'label': '😊', 'probability': 0.3179638981819153}
```

- ***Emotion Recognition***: Predict the emotion of the tweet from four classes: `anger`/`joy`/`optimism`/`sadness`.

```python
model = tweetnlp.load('emotion')  # Or `model = tweetnlp.Emotion()` 
model.emotion('I love swimming for the same reason I love meditating...the feeling of weightlessness.')  # Or `model.predict`
>>> {'label': 'joy', 'probability': 0.7345258593559265}
```

### Information Extraction
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/104MtF9MXkDFimlJLr4SFBX0HjidLTfvp#scrollTo=WeREiLEjBlrj)

The information extraction module consists of named-entity recognition (NER) model specifically trained for tweets.
The model is instantiated by `tweetnlp.load("ner")`, and run the prediction by giving a text or a list of texts.


- ***Named Entity Recognition***

```python3
model = tweetnlp.load('ner')  # Or `model = tweetnlp.NER()` 
model.ner('Jacob Collier is a Grammy-awarded English artist from London.')  # Or `model.predict`
>>> {
    'prediction': ['B-person', 'I-person', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-location'],
    'probability': [0.9606876969337463, 0.9834017753601074, 0.9816871285438538, 0.9896021485328674, 0.44137904047966003, 0.375810831785202, 0.8757674694061279, 0.9786785244941711, 0.9398059248924255],
    'input': ['Jacob', 'Collier', 'is', 'a', 'Grammy-awarded', 'English', 'artist', 'from', 'London.'],
    'entity_prediction': [
        {'type': 'person', 'entity': ['Jacob', 'Collier'], 'position': [0, 1], 'probability': [0.9606876969337463, 0.9834017753601074]},
        {'type': 'location', 'entity': ['London.'], 'position': [8], 'probability': [0.9398059248924255]}]
}
```

### Language Modeling
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/104MtF9MXkDFimlJLr4SFBX0HjidLTfvp#scrollTo=COOoZHVAFCIG)

Masked language model predicts masked token in the given sentence. This is instantiated by `tweetnlp.load('language_model')`, and run the prediction by giving a text or a list of texts. Please make sure that each text has `<mask>` token, that is the objective of the model to predict.

```python
model = tweetnlp.load('language_model')  # Or `model = tweetnlp.LanguageModel()` 
model.mask_prediction("How many more <mask> until opening day? 😩")  # Or `model.predict`
```

### Tweet/Sentence Embedding
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/104MtF9MXkDFimlJLr4SFBX0HjidLTfvp#scrollTo=MUT31bNQYTNz)

Tweet embedding model produces a fixed length embedding for a tweet. The embedding represents the semantics of the tweet, and this can be used a semantic search of tweets by using the similarity in betweein the embeddings. Model is instantiated by `tweet_nlp.load('sentence_embedding')`, and run the prediction by giving a text or a list of texts.

- ***Get Embedding***

```python
model = tweetnlp.load('sentence_embedding')  # Or `model = tweetnlp.SentenceEmbedding()` 

# Get sentence embedding
tweet = "I will never understand the decision making of the people of Alabama. Their new Senator is a definite downgrade. You have served with honor.  Well done."
vectors = model.embedding(tweet)
vectors.shape
>>> (768,)

# Get sentence embedding (multiple inputs)

    "The mask cult can’t ever admit masks don’t work because their ideology is based on feeling like a “good person”  Wearing a mask makes them a “good person” &amp; anyone who disagrees w/them isn’t  They can’t tolerate any idea that makes them feel like their self-importance is unearned",
    "@ianmSC Beyond that, they put such huge confidence in masks so early with no strong evidence that they have any meaningful benefit, they don’t want to backtrack or admit they were wrong. They put the cart before the horse, now desperate to find any results that match their hypothesis.",

- ***Similarity Search***

```python
sims = []
for n, i in enumerate(tweet_corpus):
  _sim = model.similarity(tweet, i)
  sims.append([n, _sim])
print(f'anchor tweet: {tweet}\n')
for m, (n, s) in enumerate(sorted(sims, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:3]):
  print(f' - top {m}: {tweet_corpus[n]}\n - similaty: {s}\n')
