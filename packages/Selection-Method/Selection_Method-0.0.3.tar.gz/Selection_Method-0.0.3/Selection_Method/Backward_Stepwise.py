    NAME
        backward_stepwise

    DESCRIPTION
        Statistical Learning module for Python
        --------------------------------------

        backward_stepwise is a Python module which implements a statistical 
        learning method for selecting features (for predicting a target variable) 
        in a given dataset.

        This selection process is done by an iterative and eliminative 
        process of testing each feature and subsequently combining them
        in an decremental manner till the best set of features are found.

    CLASS ARGUMENTS
        reg_model : regression model object
            A specific regression model object (linear, ridge, lasso, logic etc.)

        """
        The select_features() method takes in four sets of data (two for 
        testing and two for training), and subjects these data to the
        backward stepwise method, so as to select the optimal features.

        Parameters
        ----------
        x_train : pandas.core.frame.DataFrame
            The dataset containing the independent variables used for training.
        X_test : pandas.core.frame.DataFrame
            The dataset containing the independent variables used for testing.
        y_train : pandas.core.frame.DataFrame
            The dataset containing the target variable used for training.
        y_test : pandas.core.frame.DataFrame
            The dataset containing the target variable used for testing.

        Returns
        -------
        final_list
            A list of the independent features selected by the algorithm.
        max(scores_)
            The predictive accuracy of the features in the final_list.
