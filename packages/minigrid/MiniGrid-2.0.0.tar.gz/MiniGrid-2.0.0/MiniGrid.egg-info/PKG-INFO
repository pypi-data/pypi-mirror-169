# MiniGrid (formerly gym-minigrid)

There are other gridworld Gymnasium environments out there, but this one is
designed to be particularly simple, lightweight and fast. The code has very few
dependencies, making it less likely to break or fail to install. It loads no
external sprites/textures, and it can run at up to 5000 FPS on a Core i7
laptop, which means you can run your experiments faster. A known-working RL
implementation can be found [in this repository](https://github.com/lcswillems/torch-rl).

Requirements:
- Python 3.7 to 3.10
- Gymnasium v0.26
- NumPy 1.18+
- Matplotlib (optional, only needed for display) - 3.0+

This environment has been built as part of work done at [Mila](https://mila.quebec). The Dynamic obstacles environment has been added as part of work done at [IAS in TU Darmstadt](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/) and the University of Genoa for mobile robot navigation with dynamic obstacles.
