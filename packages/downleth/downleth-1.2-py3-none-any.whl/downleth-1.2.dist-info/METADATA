# Lecture Downloader ETH

Download livestreams, watch livestreams locally (and reliably!)

As always, respect the privacy of the people being recorded and do not publicise anything you record without first requesting permission to do so. `downleth`'s main use case is recording livestreamed lectures and having them immediately available, especially if one is unable to attend lectures in a certain timespan.

## Installation

Install `downleth`:

```bash
pip install downleth
```

Make sure you have `ffmpeg` installed.

## Usage

To schedule a lecture recording based on a config:

```bash
downleth --log-level INFO exec sample-config.json
```

For structuring your configuration file, see `sample-config.json`. There is also a `config.schema.json` JSON schema.

## Development

`pipenv` is used. Use:

```bash
PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT=1 pipenv install
```

The `vscode` task might help you get started with debugging.

## TODO

- Automatically generate configuration file per semester from myStudies, fetch room numbers, etc. automatically
- Allow spinning up local server to watch lectures without web client
- Allow configuring codecs (save storage)
- Automatically cut breaks somehow
- Automatically detect start/end of lecture (might sometimes end a bit later or start a bit earlier)
- Consider holidays
- Use GitHub actions to publish, maybe GitVersion to version it
- Allow downloading recordings form video.ethz.ch
