# afam - ASC Files Analyzing Module

This module allows the user to analyze a ASC file, created by the EDF2ASC translator program of
SR Research. This program converts selected events and samples from the EyeLink EDF file into
text, and sorts and formats the data into a form that is easier to work with.

This module helps to perform the following operations:
 - Opening and closing the ASC file
 - Matching words and messages to keywords (tokens)
 - Reading data items from the file, including recording start, button presses, eye events and
   messages (samples are not supported)

This module requires that `dataclasses` are available within the Python environment the user is
running the module in.

It contains the following classes:
 - **ASC_BUTTON** - a dataclass used to store the data from a "BUTTON" line
 - **ASC_SBLINK** - a dataclass used to store the data from a "SBLINK" line
 - **ASC_SSACC** - a dataclass used to store the data from a "SSACC" line
 - **ASC_SFIX** - a dataclass used to store the data from a "SFIX" line
 - **ASC_EBLINK** - a dataclass used to store the data from an "EBLINK" line
 - **ASC_ESACC** - a dataclass used to store the data from an "ESACC" line
 - **ASC_EFIX** - a dataclass used to store the data from an "EFIX" line
 - **ASC_MSG** - a dataclass used to store the data from a "MSG" line
 - **ASC_File_Handler** - a class used to handle the parsing of an ASC file

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install afam
```

## Usage

```python
from afam import ASC_File_Handler

handler = afam.ASC_File_Handler()
event_list = handler.read_asc_file(file_name)
```
