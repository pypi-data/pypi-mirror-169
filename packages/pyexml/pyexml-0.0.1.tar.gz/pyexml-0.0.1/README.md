## Overview

Running machine learning experiments can be a huge hassle. Optimizing hyper parameters, saving off specific data throughout epochs, and modifying models without breaking code are just a few of the headaches I come across on a daily basis. `pyexml` simplifies the design process for machine learning experimentation by building on top of the `pyexlab` package.
