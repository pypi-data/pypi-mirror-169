        **NAME**
        
        | ``opr`` - write your own commands.
        |
        
        **SYNOPSIS**
        
        
        | ``oper [-c] [-i] [-r]``
        | ``oper <cmd> [key=value] [key==value]``
        |
        
        **DESCRIPTION**
        
        With **OPR** your can have the commands of a irc bot available on your cli.
        Instead of having to join a irc channel and give commands to your bot, you
        can run these commands on your shell.
        
        **OPR** is a solid, non hackable, and is intended to be programmable in a
        static, only code, no popen, fixed imports and no reading modules from a
        directory, to not have a directory to read modules from to add
        commands to the bot but include the own programmed modules directly into the
        python code, so only trusted code (your own written code) is included and
        runable. Reading random code from a directory is what gets avoided. As
        experience tells os.popen and __import__, importlib are also avoided, direct
        imports in the code is what is used.
        
        **OPR** stores it's data on disk where objects are time versioned and the
        last version saved on disk is served to the user layer. Files are JSON dumps
        that are read-only so thus should provide (disk) persistence. Paths carry the
        type in the path name what makes reconstruction from filename easier then
        reading type from the object.

        **INSTALL**
        
        | ``pip3 install opr --upgrade --force-reinstall``
        |
        
        **PROGRAMMING**
        
        The ``opr`` package provides an Object class, that mimics a dict while using
        attribute access and provides a save/load to/from json files on disk.
        Objects can be searched with database functions and uses read-only files
        to improve persistence and a type in filename for reconstruction. Methods are
        factored out into functions to have a clean namespace to read JSON data into.
        
        basic usage is this::
        
        >>> import opr
        >>> o = opr.Object()
        >>> o.key = "value"
        >>> o.key
        >>> 'value'
        
        Objects try to mimic a dictionary while trying to be an object with normal
        attribute access as well. hidden methods are provided, the methods are
        factored out into functions like get, items, keys, register, set, update
        and values.
        
        load/save from/to disk::
        
        >>> from opr import Object, load, save
        >>> o = Object()
        >>> o.key = "value"
        >>> p = save(o)
        >>> obj = Object()
        >>> load(obj, p)
        >>> obj.key
        >>> 'value'
        
        great for giving objects peristence by having their state stored in files::
        
         >>> from opr import Object, save
         >>> o = Object()
         >>> save(o)
         'opr.obj.Object/2021-08-31/15:31:05.717063'
