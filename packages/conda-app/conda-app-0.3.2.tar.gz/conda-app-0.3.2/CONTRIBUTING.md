# How to contribute to conda-app

Thank you for considering contributing to conda-app. conda-app is a
community-driven project. It's people like you that make conda-app useful and
successful. There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or
examples, improvements to the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature
requests, or even writing code which can be incorporated into conda-app for
everyone to use. (Paragraph shamelessly taken and adapted from the MetPy
project!)

## Reporting Issues

When opening an issue to report a problem
(<https://foss.heptapod.net/fluiddyn/conda-app/issues>), please try to provide
a minimal code example that reproduces the issue along with details of the
system you are using. You can copy-paste the output of the command `fluidinfo
-v` provided by the Python package
[fluiddyn](https://pypi.org/project/fluiddyn/) ([Github
gists](https://gist.github.com/) are good for that!).

## Development process

conda-app is part of the wider project FluidDyn. For FluidDyn, we use the
revision control software Mercurial and our main repositories are hosted here:
<https://foss.heptapod.net/fluiddyn>.

Please read our documentation on [developer
essentials](https://fluiddyn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advice_developers.html),
and especially on [setting up
Mercurial](https://fluiddyn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mercurial_heptapod.html).
