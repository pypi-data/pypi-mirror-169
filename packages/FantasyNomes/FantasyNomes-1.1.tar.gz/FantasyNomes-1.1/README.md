```

## Quickstart



```python
>>>import FantasyNomes as fn

>>># x0, x1, x2, ... ,xn

>>>poly1 = fn.Polynome([1,1,2])
>>>poly2 = fn.Polynome([0,1])

>>>poly1
2*X^2+1*X^1+1

>>>print(poly2)
1*X^1

>>>poly2 - 4
1*X^1-4

>>>type(poly1)
FantasyNomes.polynome.Polynome

>>># degree
>>>len(poly1)
2

>>>print(poly1 * -1 )
-2*X^2-1*X^1-1

>>>div, res = poly1/poly2

>>>print(div)
2.0*X^1+1.0

>>>print(res)
1

>>>poly1==poly1
True

>>>poly1==poly2
False

>>>poly3 = fn.Polynome([1])
>>>print( poly3*poly2)
1*X^2
