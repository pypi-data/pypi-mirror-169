Package slicemap is introducing a useful, dictionary-like data structure,
similar to normal Python dict, but instead of setting values key by key, you set entire slices.

* Implemented entirely in Python
* Has only one dependency: [sortedcontainers](https://grantjenks.com/docs/sortedcontainers/)
* Is efficient, it has `O(log(n))` time complexity for insertion and query
    * Adding new slices might make old ones become redundant, `n` correspondes to the maximal number of slices present in SliceMap at a time
* Makes life easier, see [applications](https://gahaalt.github.io/slicemap/applications/)

Install easily with pip:

```
pip install slicemap
```
