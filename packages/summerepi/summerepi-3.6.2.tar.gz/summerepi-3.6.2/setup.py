    'long_description': '# Summer: compartmental disease modelling in Python\n\n[![Automated Tests](https://github.com/monash-emu/summer/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/monash-emu/summer/actions/workflows/tests.yml)\n\nSummer is a Python-based framework for the creation and execution of [compartmental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology) (or "state-based") epidemiological models of infectious disease transmission.\n\nIt provides a range of structures for easily implementing compartmental models, including structure for some of the most common features added to basic compartmental frameworks, including:\n\n- A variety of inter-compartmental flows (infections, transitions, births, deaths, imports)\n- Force of infection multipliers (frequency, density)\n- Post-processing of compartment sizes into derived outputs\n- Stratification of compartments, including:\n  - Adjustments to flow rates based on strata\n  - Adjustments to infectiousness based on strata\n  - Heterogeneous mixing between strata\n  - Multiple disease strains\n\nSome helpful links to learn more:\n\n- [Rationale](http://summerepi.com/rationale.html) for why we are building Summer\n- **[Documentation](http://summerepi.com/)** with [code examples](http://summerepi.com/examples)\n- [Available on PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/summerepi/) as `summerepi`.\n- [Performance benchmarks](https://monash-emu.github.io/summer/)\n\n## Installation and Quickstart\n\nThis project requires at least Python 3.7 (and is actively targeted at 3.9)\nInstall the `summerepi` package from PyPI\n\n```bash\npip install summerepi\n```\n\nThen you can use the library to build and run models. See [here](http://summerepi.com/examples) for some code examples.\n\n## Development\n\n[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is used for packaging and dependency management.\n\nInitial project setup is documented [here](./docs/dev-setup.md) and should work for Windows or Ubuntu, maybe for MacOS.\n\nSome common things to do as a developer working on this codebase:\n\n```bash\n# Activate summer conda environment prior to doing other stuff (see setup docs)\nconda activate summer\n\n# Install latest requirements\npoetry install\n\n# Publish to PyPI - use your PyPI credentials\npoetry publish --build\n\n# Add a new package\npoetry add\n\n# Run tests\npytest -vv\n\n# Format Python code\nblack .\nisort . --profile black\n```\n\n## Releases\n\nReleases are numbered using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)\n\n- 1.0.0/1:\n  - Initial release\n- 1.1.0:\n  - Add stochastic integrator\n- 2.0.2:\n  - Rename fractional flow to transition flow\n  - Remove sojourn flow\n  - Add vectorized backend and other performance improvements\n- 2.0.3:\n  - Set default IVP solver to use a maximum step size of 1 timestep\n- 2.0.4:\n  - Add runtime derived values\n- 2.0.5:\n  - Remove legacy Summer implementation\n- 2.1.0:\n  - Add AdjustmentSystems\n  - Improve vectorization of flows\n  - Add computed_values inputs to flow and adjustment parameters\n- 2.1.1:\n  - Fix for invalid/unused package imports (cachetools)\n- 2.2.0\n  - Add validation and compartment caching optimizations\n- 2.2.1\n  - Derived output index caching\n  - Optimized fast-tracks for infectious multipliers\n- 2.2.2\n  - JIT infectiousness calculations\n  - Various micro-optimizations\n- 2.2.3\n  - Bugfix release (clamp outputs to 0.0)\n- 2.2.4\n  - Datetime awareness, DataFrame outputs\n- 2.2.5\n  - Performance improvements (frozenset), no API changes\n- 2.2.6\n  - Verify strata in flow adjustments (prevent unexpected behaviour)\n- 2.2.7\n  - Rename add_flow_adjustments -> set_flow_adjustments\n- 2.2.8\n  - Split imports functionality (add_importation_flow now requires split_imports arg)\n- 2.2.9\n  - Post-stratification population restribution\n- 2.3.0\n  - First official version to support only Python 3.7\n- 2.5.0\n  - Support Python 3.9\n- 2.6.0\n  - Merge 3.9/master branches\n- 2.7.0\n  - Include Python 3.10 support and update requirements\n- 3.6.0\n  - Summer \'classic\' end-of-line release\n\n## Release process\n\nTo do a release:\n\n- Commit any code changes and push them to GitHub\n- Choose a new release number accoridng to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)\n- Add a release note above\n- Edit the `version` key in `pyproject.toml` to reflect the release number\n- Publish the package to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/summerepi/) using Poetry, you will need a PyPI login and access to the project\n- Commit the release changes and push them to GitHub (Use a commit message like "Release 1.1.0")\n- Update `requirements.txt` in Autumn to use the new version of Summer\n\n```bash\npoetry build\npoetry publish\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nSphinx is used to automatically build reference documentation for this library.\nThe documentation is automatically built and deployed to [summerepi.com](http://summerepi.com/) whenever code is pushed to `master`.\n\nTo run or edit the code examples in the documentation, start a jupyter notebook server as follows:\n\n```bash\njupyter notebook --config docs/jupyter_notebook_config.py\n# Go to http://localhost:8888/tree/docs/examples in your web browser.\n```\n\nYou can clean outputs from all the example notbooks with\n\n```bash\n./docs/scripts/clean.sh\n```\n\nTo build and deploy\n\n```bash\n./docs/scripts/build.sh\n./docs/scripts/deploy.sh\n```\n\nTo work on docs locally\n\n```bash\n./docs/scripts/watch.sh\n```\n',
